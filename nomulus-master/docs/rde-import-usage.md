# Registry Data Import Usage Guide

In order to import an RDE escrow file into Nomulus, four different mapreduce
processes must be run in sequence. Future iterations of this feature may
automate the sequence, but for now each step of the process must be run
manually.

Note that only contacts, hosts and domains are imported by this process. Other
objects such as registrars and top level domains are not imported automatically,
and must be configured before running this import process (see below).

## Prerequisites

This document assumes that the import process is being executed against a fully
functioning instance of Nomulus that is set up with its own unique project
id. See the other docs (particularly the [install guide](./install.md)) for
details and helpful links.

Before launching any of the import jobs, the top level domain (TLD) and all
registrars that are included in the escrow file must be created in the registry;
these cannot be created automatically. Detailed instructions on how to create
TLDs, registrars and registrar contacts can be found in
the [first steps tutorial](./first-steps-tutorial.md).

## How to load an escrow file

First of all, ensure that all of the cloud storage buckets are set up for
nomulus.  See the [architecture documentation](./app-engine-architecture.md) for
details.  The escrow file that will be imported should be uploaded to the
`PROJECT-rde-import` cloud storage bucket. The escrow file should not be
compressed or encrypted. When launching each mapreduce job, reference the
absolute path to the file (just the path, not the bucket name) in the `path`
argument.

__TODO:__ Add `PROJECT-rde-import` bucket requirement to architecture doc.

## Overview of import steps

Due to the huge variety in size of domain registries, the number of objects
included in escrow files can also vary widely. In order to process these files
in a way that scales, the import of contacts, hosts and domains has been
implemented as a series of four mapreduce jobs. The four jobs are summarized as
follows:

* Contacts Import - Creates contacts in the registry.
* Hosts Import - Creates host objects in the registry. Note that only host
  objects are supported at this time; escrow files with host attributes are not
  supported and will be rejected by the import process.
* Domains Import - Creates domain objects in the registry. This step will also
  publish NS records and A records to dns as necessary based on referenced host
  objects.
* Hosts Link - Links hosts to their superordinate domain objects. This step is
  necessary to establish data integrity for imported objects.

The import steps __must__ be run in this order: Contacts Import, Hosts Import,
Domains Import, Hosts Link.

## Executing the import process

The import process steps must be executed by a user that is logged in as an
administrator of the deployed Nomulus instance. Currently, the way to launch the
process is to manually enter the proper url into the user's web browser, which
will kick off the mapreduce job and load its status page. The status page will
serve as a way to monitor the progress of a job until completion. Once each job
is completed, the user can launch the next step in the same fashion.

Parameters:

* path - This is the path to the escrow file in cloud storage.
* mapShards - This is the number of shards that will be used to process the
  file.  The process has been tested with a mapShards setting of 100, which
  seems to perform well in most cases.

The import process is deployed in the `backend` service, so "backend-dot-" will
be prepended to the hostname. Replace `PROJECT` below with the unique project
name under which the Nomulus instance is deployed, and `PATH` with the path to
the escrow file.

Launch Contacts Import:
`https://backend-dot-PROJECT.appspot.com/_dr/importRdeContacts?path=PATH&mapShards=100`

Launch Hosts Import:
`https://backend-dot-PROJECT.appspot.com/_dr/importRdeHosts?path=PATH&mapShards=100`

Launch Domains Import:
`https://backend-dot-PROJECT.appspot.com/_dr/importRdeDomains?path=PATH&mapShards=100`

Launch Hosts Link:
`https://backend-dot-PROJECT.appspot.com/_dr/linkRdeHosts?path=PATH&mapShards=100`

For each job, the mapreduce user interface will display the status of the
running job.  The job is finished when all of the boxes on the left turn green
(at which point the next step of the process can be safely launched). If any of
the boxes turn red, it means that the job failed and the logs should be
consulted for errors (see below).

Note that each of these steps is idempotent, and can be run many times with no
harmful side effects or duplicated data.

## Monitoring and troubleshooting

On the status page, several counters will be shown as the job progresses,
indicating the number of operations attempted, how many succeeded, how many were
ignored, and if there were any errors. This is a good tool to understand at a
high level how the job is progressing. The counters from a completed job can
also be compared against the known count of resources from an escrow file to
determine if the import was successful or not.

For a more detailed view, open up the logging for the project in
the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com). The application
logs from the import process will show up under requests with a url that starts
with `/_dr/mapreduce/workerCallback` - the logs provide a detailed view of which
resources were read from file, which were imported, which had already existed
before the import, and which failed to import.

## Known limitations

Currently, the ID of all registrars in the escrow file must match those that are
already configured in the registry. Future work is planned to map between
different internal and external registrar IDs by using the IANA IDs, which are
always consistent between registries.
