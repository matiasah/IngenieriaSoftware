/**
 * Display helpful failure message if a mocked method is called.
 *
 * <p>One important problem this solves is when you mock servlets and the test fails, you usually
 * end up with failure messages like {@code Wanted but not invoked: rsp.setStatus(200)} which
 * aren't very helpful. This is because servlets normally report problems by calling
 * {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse#sendError(int, String) rsp.sendError()} so it'd be
 * nice if we could have the error message be whatever arguments get passed to {@code sendError}.
 *
 * <p>And that's where {@link FailAnswer} comes to the rescue! Here's an example of what you could
 * put at the beginning of a servlet test method to have better error messages:
 *
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   doAnswer(new FailAnswer<>()).when(rsp).sendError(anyInt());
 *   doAnswer(new FailAnswer<>()).when(rsp).sendError(anyInt(), anyString());
 *   }</pre>
 *
 * @param <T> The return type of the mocked method (which doesn't actually return).
