/**
 * Implementation of the procedure for determining point-in-time consistent commit log checkpoint.
 *
 * <p>This algorithm examines the recently written commit log data and uses a dual-read approach
 * to determine a point-in-time consistent set of checkpoint times for the commit log buckets.  By
 * "consistent" we mean, generally speaking, that if the Datastore were restored by replaying all
 * the commit logs up to the checkpoint times of the buckets, the result would be transactionally
 * correct; there must be no "holes" where restored state depends on non-restored state.
 *
 * <p>The consistency guarantee really has two parts, only one of which is provided by this
 * algorithm.  The procedure below guarantees only that if the resulting checkpoint includes any
 * given commit log, it will also include all the commit logs that were both 1) actually written
 * before that commit log "in real life", and 2) have an earlier timestamp than that commit log.
 * (These criteria do not necessarily imply each other, due to the lack of a global shared clock.)
 * The rest of the guarantee comes from our Ofy customizations, which ensure that any transaction
 * that depends on state from a previous transaction does indeed have a later timestamp.
 *
 * <h2>Procedure description</h2>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * ComputeCheckpoint() -> returns a set consisting of a timestamp c(b_i) for every bucket b_i
 *
 * 1) read off the latest commit timestamp t(b_i) for every bucket b_i
 * 2) iterate over the buckets b_i a second time, and
 *   a) do a consistent query for the next commit timestamp t'(b_i) where t'(b_i) > t(b_i)
 *   b) if present, add this timestamp t'(b_i) to a set S
 * 3) compute a threshold time T* representing a time before all commits in S, as follows:
 *   a) if S is empty, let T* = +∞ (or the "end of time")
 *   b) else, let T* = T - Δ, for T = min(S) and some small Δ > 0
 * 4) return the set given by: min(t(b_i), T*) for all b_i
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Correctness proof of algorithm</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@literal
 * As described above, the algorithm is correct as long as it can ensure the following: given a
 * commit log X written at time t(X) to bucket b_x, and another commit log Y that was written "in
 * real life" before X and for which t(Y) < t(X), then if X is included in the checkpoint, so is Y;
 * that is, t(X) <= c(b_x) implies t(Y) <= c(b_y).
 * }
 *
 * <p>{@literal
 * To prove this, first note that we always have c(b_i) <= t(b_i) for every b_i, i.e. every commit
 * log included in the checkpoint must have been seen in the first pass.  Hence if X was included,
 * then X must have been written by the time we started the second pass.  But since Y was written
 * "in real life" prior to X, we must have seen Y by the second pass too.
 * }
 *
 * <p>{@literal
 * Now assume towards a contradiction that X is indeed included but Y is not, i.e. that we have
 * t(X) <= c(b_x) but t(Y) > c(b_y).  If Y was seen in the first pass, i.e. t(Y) <= t(b_y), then by
 * our assumption c(b_y) < t(Y) <= t(b_y), and therefore c(b_y) != t(b_y).  By the definition of
 * c(b_y) it must then equal T*, so we have T* < t(Y).  However, this is a contradiction since
 * t(Y) < t(X) and t(X) <= c(b_x) <= T*.  If instead Y was seen in the second pass but not the
 * first, t'(b_y) exists and we must have t'(b_y) <= t(Y), but then since T* < T <= t'(b_y) by
 * definition, we again reach the contradiction T* < t(Y).
 * }
