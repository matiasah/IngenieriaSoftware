/**
 * This package defines all entities which are managed via EPP XML and persisted to the Datastore
 * via Objectify.
 *
 * <p>All first class entities are represented as a "Resource" class - {@link DomainResource},
 * {@link HostResource}, {@link ContactResource}, and {@link RegistrarResource}. Resource objects
 * are written in a single shared entity group per TLD. All commands that operate on those entities
 * are grouped in a "Command" class- {@link DomainCommand}, {@link HostCommand},
 * {@link ContactCommand}. The Resource does double duty as both the persisted representation and as
 * the XML-marshallable object returned in respond to Info commands.
 *
 * <p>Command classes are never persisted, and the Objectify annotations on the Create and Update
 * classes are purely for the benefit of the derived Resource classes that inherit from them.
 * Whenever a command that mutates the model is executed, a HistoryEvent is stored with the affected
 * Resource as its Datastore parent. All history entries have an indexed modification time field so
 * that the history can be read in chronological order.
