/**
 * The root key for the entity group which is known as the cross-tld entity group for historical
 * reasons.
 *
 * <p>This exists as a storage place for common configuration options and global settings that
 * aren't updated too frequently.  Entities in this entity group are usually cached upon load.  The
 * reason this common entity group exists is because it enables strongly consistent queries and
 * updates across this seldomly updated data.  This shared entity group also helps cut down on
 * a potential ballooning in the number of entity groups enlisted in transactions.
 *
 * <p>Historically, each TLD used to have a separate namespace, and all entities for a TLD were in
 * a single EntityGroupRoot for that TLD.  Hence why there was a "cross-tld" entity group -- it was
 * the entity group for the single namespace where global data applicable for all TLDs lived.
