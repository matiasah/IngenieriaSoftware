/**
 * Utility method to create a {@link CustomFitter} with intervals using the Fibonacci sequence.
 *
 * <p>A Fibonacci fitter is useful in situations where you want more precision on the low end than
 * an {@link ExponentialFitter} with exponent base 2 would provide without the hassle of dealing
 * with non-integer boundaries, such as would be created by an exponential fitter with a base of
 * less than 2. Fibonacci fitters are ideal for integer metrics that are bounded across a certain
 * range, e.g. integers between 1 and 1,000.
 *
 * <p>The interval boundaries are chosen as {@code (-inf, 0), [0, 1), [1, 2), [2, 3), [3, 5), [5,
 * 8), [8, 13)}, etc., up to {@code [fibonacciFloor(maxBucketSize), inf)}.
