/**
 * Command to delete an entity (or entities) in Datastore specified by raw key ids, which can be
 * found in Datastore Viewer in the AppEngine console -- it's the really long alphanumeric key that
 * is labeled "Entity key" on the page for an individual entity.
 *
 * <p><b>WARNING:</b> This command can be dangerous if used incorrectly as it can bypass checks on
 * deletion (including whether the entity is referenced by other entities) and it does not write
 * commit log entries for non-registered types. It should mainly be used for deleting testing or
 * malformed data that cannot be properly deleted using existing tools. Generally, if there already
 * exists an entity-specific deletion command, then use that one instead.
