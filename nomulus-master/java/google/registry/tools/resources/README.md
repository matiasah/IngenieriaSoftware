# Adding Client Secrets

This directory contains the client secret files needed by the `nomulus` tool to
connect to the Nomulus backend via OAuth2. Adding client secret files to this
directory is one of two steps you need to perform; the other is adding the
client id contained in the client secret file to the list of allowed ids in the
Nomulus configuration file. See the configuration documentation for more
information.
