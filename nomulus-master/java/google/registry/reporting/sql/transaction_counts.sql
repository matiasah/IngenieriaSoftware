  -- Counts the number of mutating transactions each registrar made.

  -- We populate the fields through explicit logging of
  -- DomainTransactionRecords, which contain all necessary information for
  -- reporting (such as reporting time, report field, report amount, etc.

  -- A special note on transfers: we only record 'TRANSFER_SUCCESSFUL' or
  -- 'TRANSFER_NACKED', and we can infer the gaining and losing parties
  -- from the enclosing HistoryEntry's clientId and otherClientId
  -- respectively. This query templates the client ID, field for transfer
  -- success, field for transfer nacks and default field. This allows us to
  -- create one query for TRANSFER_GAINING and the other report fields,
  -- and one query for TRANSFER_LOSING fields from the same template.

-- This outer select just converts the registrar's clientId to their name.
